Description:
   
   This program supports Grandma Robin and is designed to help her organize recommendations for a vacation that her thirteen
   family members have suggested. The program is designed to let the user add a recommendation, display all recommendations
   on record, find the budget recommendation, find the most extravagant recommendation, and to exit the program. If the user 
   chooses to add a recommendation, the program will ask the user if the vacation is by air or by car. If the user chooses by
   air, the program will ask for the family member’s name, phone number, destination for the vacation, a list of activities 
   and their corresponding cost per person, and the cost of the plane ticket.  If the user chooses by car, the program will 
   ask for the family member’s name, phone number, destination for the vacation, a list of activities and their corresponding
   cost per person, the number of miles of the trip, and a list of cars being taken. If the user chooses to display all 
   recommendations on record, the program will display the name, phone number, destination name, list of activities and their
   cost per person, the plane ticket cost if the vacation is by air, the number of miles and the list of cars taken if the 
   vacation is by car, and finally, the total cost of the vacation. If the user chooses to find the budget recommendation, 
   the program will display all the information about a recommendation that has the lowest total vacation cost. Likewise, if 
   the user chooses to find the most extravagant recommendation, the program will display all the information about a 
   recommendation that has the highest total vacation cost. If the user chooses to quit the application, the program will 
   display a message that counts the number of vacations by car and by air. Additionally, the program will display if a 
   vacation by car has a BMW under the car list.
